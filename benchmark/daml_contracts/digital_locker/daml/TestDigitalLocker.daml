{- 
  1. The owner creates a DigitalLocker contract in the Requested state.
  2. The test ensures that:
      - Unauthorized users (owner, third parties) cannot begin the review process.
      - Only the bank agent can transition the contract to DocumentReview.
      - Unauthorized users cannot upload documents.
  3. The bank agent successfully uploads documents, transitioning to AvailableToShare.
  4. A third party requests access, transitioning the contract to SharingRequestPending.
  5. The test ensures that:
      - Only the owner can accept or reject a sharing request.
      - Another third party cannot request access while a request is pending.
  6. The owner rejects the first request, reverting back to AvailableToShare.
  7. A second third party requests access, and the owner accepts, transitioning to SharingWithThirdParty.
  8. The test ensures that:
      - Unauthorized users cannot release access.
      - The third party who received access can release access, returning to AvailableToShare.
  9. The owner manually shares access again and later revokes it, ensuring correct state transitions.
  10. The test ensures that:
      - Unauthorized users cannot terminate the contract.
      - The bank agent can terminate the contract, transitioning to Terminated.
