{- 
  1. The airline representative (airlineRep) and a frequent flier (flier) are allocated.
  2. The airline representative creates a FrequentFlier contract, initializing the rewards system.
  3. The test ensures that:
      - The airline representative cannot add miles.
      - The frequent flier can successfully add miles.
      - The airline representative still cannot add miles after the flier has.
      - The flier can retrieve the list of miles.
      - The flier can retrieve the total rewards.
  4. The test verifies that the correct number of miles and rewards are calculated.
