# Azure Translations
## Azure Benchmark
The Azure benchmark can be found at:
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/blockchain/tree/master/blockchain-workbench/application-and-smart-contract-samples

## Overview
This repository contains translations of Azure smart contracts (written in Solidity) into Daml, along with unit tests for each contract. Each folder includes:

1-Daml Translation: A contract written in Daml that replicates the functionality of the original Azure smart contract.
2-Unit Tests: Daml script tests to validate the correct execution of most state transitions and role-based access control.

## Execution Trace Commentary
Writing every significant execution trace by hand is impractical due to the complexity and number of possible transitions in real-world contract executions.
