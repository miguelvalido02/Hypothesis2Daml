This wallet can be used by the owner to make transactions by calling `the
executeExternalTx()` function, by provinding the desired recipient
contract/externally owned account (EOA), an ether value, and arbitrary data.

In case of lost private key, a recovery process can be initiated by a guardian.
The guardian first calls `initiateRecovery()` with the address of the new
owner, followed by a threshold number of guardians calling `supportRecovery()`
with the new owner's address. Finally, any guardian can call
`executeRecovery()` to change the wallet's owner.

Additionally, owners have the ability to manage guardians by removing
compromised or malicious guardians. The owner initiates the removal process by
calling `initiateGuardianRemoval()` with the hash of the guardian's address,
which queues the guardian for removal after a 3-day delay. The owner then calls
`executeGuardianRemoval()` after the delay, providing the hash of a new
guardian's address to finalize the removal and add the new guardian.
Alternatively, the owner can call `cancelGuardianRemoval()` to restore the
guardian state.
